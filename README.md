# IPV

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The aim of IPV is to handily create item pool visualizations, as
introduced in: [Dantlgraber, M., Stieger, S., & Reips, U. D. (2019).
Introducing Item Pool Visualization: A method for investigation of
concepts in self-reports and psychometric tests. Methodological
Innovations, 12(3), 2059799119884283.](https://doi.org/10.1177/2059799119884283)

## Installation

You can install the released version of IPV from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) by calling:

``` r
install.packages("IPV")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by
calling:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NilsPetras/IPV")
```

## Usage

This is an example how charts can be created:

``` r
library(IPV)

# Here, a toy example provided in the package is used.
# ?HEXACO

# estimate the underlying model from (clean) raw data
x <- ipv_est(HEXACO[ ,c(2:41, 122:161)], "HA")
#> Negative center distance adjusted to 0
#> Negative center distance adjusted to 0
#> Negative center distance adjusted to 0

# create a nested chart (one of three available chart types)
nested_chart(x$est)
#> Facet circle radius set to 0.204 based on the data.
#> cor_spacing set to 0.23 based on the data.
#> Relative scaling set to 2.1 based on the data.
#> Axis tick set to 0.2 based on the data.
#> dist_construct_label set to 0.333 based on the data.
```
