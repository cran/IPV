#'Input Manual Nested
#'
#'Generates manual data input for a nested model with several tests.
#'
#'@param construct_name character; the name of the overall construct.
#'@param test_names character; the names of the tests in correct order.
#'@param items_per_test integer; number of items per test in correct order
#'  (determined by test_names), if all tests have the same number of items a
#'  single number can be used, e.g. 10 instead of c(10, 10, 10).
#'@param item_names character or integer; the names of the items in correct
#'  order (determined by test_names).
#'@param construct_loadings integer; vector of the factor loadings from the
#'  single factor model of the construct in correct order (determined by
#'  item_names).
#'@param test_loadings integer; vector of the factor loadings on the test
#'  factors from the group factor model in correct order (determined by
#'  item_names).
#'@param correlation_matrix matrix containing the latent correlations between
#'  tests, pay attention to the order of rows and columns, which is determined
#'  by test_names.
#'
#'@details Pay attention to the order of tests and items, it has to be coherent
#'  throughout the whole data. test_names and items_per_test determine which
#'  test is listed first and how many items are listed for that test.
#'  item_names, construct_loadings and test_loadings have to match that order.
#'  The correlation matrix uses the order in test_names for rows and columns.
#'
#'  This function only lists the name of the tests in output$tests. For each of
#'  those tests, the data on the facets needs to be added using
#'  \code{\link{input_manual_simple}}. Every test for which you do not provide
#'  this data will be treated as having no facets.
#'
#'  Visually inspect the returned object before continuing with
#'  \code{\link{input_manual_process}}!
#'
#'@return list containing "raw" data. The data on the facets of the tests needs
#'  to be added using \code{\link{input_manual_simple}}. Afterwards, the whole
#'  data needs to be pre-processed using \code{\link{input_manual_process}}.
